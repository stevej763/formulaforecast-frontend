# Prediction Flow MVP - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

### 1. **List-Based Prediction Wizard** ‚≠ê **UPDATED**
A streamlined flow where users see all predictions upfront and can complete them in any order:
- **Overview list** showing all prediction types at once
- Click any prediction to open the selection form
- Overall progress bar showing X of Y completed
- Each prediction shows completion status and current selections
- **Back to List** button to return after making selections
- Final **Submit All** button when everything is complete
- **Supports both single driver selection AND top-3 ordered selections**

### 2. **New Components Created**

#### `driversApiClient.ts` ‚ú® **REAL API**
- Fetches all active drivers from `/api/v1/driver/all`
- Driver type matching backend:
  - `driverUid` (UUID)
  - `firstName`, `lastName`, `nickname`
  - `nationality` (CountryCode)
  - `dateOfBirth` (ISO date string)
- Proper error handling and TypeScript types

#### `mockDriverData.ts` ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPRECATED**
- Kept for reference, but no longer used
- All driver data now comes from real API

#### `PredictionFormStep.tsx` ‚≠ê **UPDATED FOR TOP-3**
- **Single Selection Mode:** Select one driver (e.g., fastest lap, pole position)
- **Top-3 Mode:** Select 3 drivers in order (e.g., race result, qualifying result)
- Automatic detection based on prediction type name
- Visual indicators:
  - ü•á Gold badge for 1st place
  - ü•à Silver badge for 2nd place
  - ü•â Bronze badge for 3rd place
- Ordered podium display at top
- Progress indicator showing X of 3 selected
- Click to add drivers in order
- Click again to remove driver
- Smart selection preventing over-selection

#### Updated `PredictionsSelectionView.tsx` ‚≠ê **REFACTORED**
Complete redesign with list-based approach:
- **List View:** Shows all prediction types as clickable cards
- **Click to Edit:** Select any prediction to open the driver selection form
- **Flexible State:** Stores `Driver[]` for each prediction (1 item or 3 items)
- **Smart Type Detection:** Automatically detects if prediction needs top-3 based on name
- **Parallel Data Loading:** Fetches both prediction types AND drivers on mount
- **Overall Progress:** Single progress bar showing total completion percentage
- **Visual Indicators:** Green checkmark for completed, gray badge for incomplete
- **Current Selections Display:** Shows selected drivers directly in the list
- **Back Navigation:** Return to list after selecting drivers
- **Mock Submission:** Logs all prediction data with positions to console
- **Validation:** Submit button disabled until all predictions are complete

## üé® UI Features

### Overall Progress
- **Single progress bar** at top showing total completion
- Percentage and count display (e.g., "3 of 5 completed - 60%")
- Green fill bar animating as predictions are completed

### Prediction List View
- **Clickable cards** for each prediction type
- **Hover effects** with border color change
- **Completion badges:**
  - Green "Complete" badge with checkmark when done
  - Gray "0/1" or "0/3" badge when incomplete
- **Current selections display:**
  - Shows selected driver name for single predictions
  - Shows numbered list (1. 2. 3.) for top-3 predictions
  - "Not yet selected" text when incomplete
- **Description text** explaining each prediction type
- **Scrollable list** with custom scrollbar
- **Visual feedback** on click

### Driver Selection Form (when prediction clicked)

**Single Selection Mode:**
- Hover effects on driver cards
- Selected state with border, background, and checkmark
- Driver name (nickname or full name)
- Nationality display
- Custom scrollbar styling (uses `ff-scrollbar` class)

**Top-3 Selection Mode:**
- Click drivers in order to build podium (1st ‚Üí 2nd ‚Üí 3rd)
- Click selected driver again to remove
- Cannot exceed 3 selections
- Visual position badges on each selected card (ü•á ü•à ü•â)
- Ordered podium display at top showing:
  - 1st place with gold badge
  - 2nd place with silver badge
  - 3rd place with bronze badge
  - Empty slots shown with dashed borders
- Progress bar showing "X of 3 selected"
- Yellow instruction text at top
- Can't proceed to next step until all 3 selected

### Navigation
- **List View:**
  - Click any prediction card to open selection form
  - "Cancel" button to exit without saving
  - "Submit All Predictions" button (disabled until all complete)
- **Selection Form:**
  - "Back to List" button to return to overview
  - "Save" button appears when selection is complete (auto-returns to list)
- No forced sequential flow - complete predictions in any order

## üîß How It Works

### Prediction Type Detection
The system automatically detects which predictions need top-3 selections based on the prediction type name:

```typescript
const requiresTopThree = (predictionType: string) => {
  const topThreeTypes = [
    'RACE_TOP_THREE', 
    'QUALIFYING_TOP_THREE', 
    'RACE_RESULT_TOP_3', 
    'QUALIFYING_RESULT_TOP_3'
  ];
  return topThreeTypes.some(type => 
    predictionType.toUpperCase().includes(type)
  );
};
```

If the prediction type contains any of these strings, it will show the top-3 UI. Otherwise, single selection mode.

### Data Flow
1. **Fetches prediction types from API** ‚úÖ Real endpoint
2. **Fetches all drivers from API** ‚úÖ Real endpoint `/api/v1/driver/all`
3. User selects driver(s) for each prediction type:
   - **Single mode:** Click to select one driver
   - **Top-3 mode:** Click 3 drivers in order for podium
4. Stores selections in `Map<predictionTypeUid, Driver[]>`
   - Array always has length 1 for single selections
   - Array has length 3 for top-3 predictions
5. Shows review screen after last step
6. Console logs submission data (mocked) ‚ö†Ô∏è Ready for real endpoint

### Real API Calls Used
```typescript
// Get all drivers
GET /api/v1/driver/all
Response: {
  drivers: [
    {
      driverUid: "uuid",
      firstName: "Max",
      lastName: "Verstappen",
      nickname: "Super Max",
      nationality: "NLD",
      dateOfBirth: "1997-09-30"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

// Get prediction types
GET /api/v1/predictions/types
Response: {
  predictionTypes: [...]
}
```

### Mock Submission Format

**Single Selection:**
```typescript
{
  userTeamUid: "...",
  raceWeekendUid: "...",
  predictionTypeUid: "...",
  driverUid: "...",
  driverName: "Max Verstappen",
  position: undefined
}
```

**Top-3 Selection (creates 3 separate entries):**
```typescript
[
  {
    userTeamUid: "...",
    raceWeekendUid: "...",
    predictionTypeUid: "race-top-3-uid",
    driverUid: "driver-1-uid",
    driverName: "Max Verstappen",
    position: 1
  },
  {
    userTeamUid: "...",
    raceWeekendUid: "...",
    predictionTypeUid: "race-top-3-uid",
    driverUid: "driver-2-uid",
    driverName: "Lewis Hamilton",
    position: 2
  },
  {
    userTeamUid: "...",
    raceWeekendUid: "...",
    predictionTypeUid: "race-top-3-uid",
    driverUid: "driver-3-uid",
    driverName: "Charles Leclerc",
    position: 3
  }
]
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (When Backend is Ready)

### ~~1. Replace Mock Driver Data~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Driver data now comes from real API endpoint!

### 2. Implement Real Submission
In `PredictionsSelectionView.tsx`, replace the mock submission:
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  try {
    // Replace this mock with real API calls
    await Promise.all(
      Array.from(predictions.entries()).map(([predictionTypeUid, driver]) =>
        submitPrediction({
          userTeamUid: team.teamUid,
          raceWeekendUid: race.raceWeekendUid,
          predictionTypeUid,
          driverUid: driver.driverUid,
        })
      )
    );
    onComplete();
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
};
```

### 3. Add Error Handling
- Toast notifications for errors
- Field-level validation
- Network error recovery

### 4. Potential Enhancements
- Save draft predictions (localStorage or API)
- Show previous predictions for the race
- Add confidence ratings or points allocation
- Animation between steps
- Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys to navigate)
- Driver search/filter functionality
- Sort drivers by name, nationality, or team

## üìù Console Output Example

When you submit predictions, check the browser console for:
```
=== MOCK PREDICTION SUBMISSION ===
Race: Monaco Grand Prix
Team: Lightning Racers
Predictions: [
  {
    userTeamUid: "...",
    raceWeekendUid: "...",
    predictionTypeUid: "...",
    driverUid: "uuid-from-api",
    driverName: "Max Verstappen"
  },
  // ... more predictions
]
================================
```
